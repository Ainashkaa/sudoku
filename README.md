# Sudoku
The objective of the Sudoku console game is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid (also called a box or region) contains 
all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. The puzzle starts with some of the cells already filled in, and the player must use logic and 
deduction to determine the correct numbers to fill in the remaining cells. The game is won when the entire grid is filled in correctly.

## Pending Features

The following features are still pending and are planned to be implemented in future versions of the Sudoku game:

- Timer: A timer to keep track of the time taken by the user to complete the Sudoku game.
- Save Best Results: A feature to save the best results achieved by the user, including the time taken and the level of difficulty.

Note: These features were not implemented in the current version of the game due to the difficulty in updating the console output in real-time to show the timer and updating the grid in place to save the best results.
